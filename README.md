A quick step on how to push files/upload your projects on Github using Gitbash terminal. Now let's get started :
Log into your Github account, click on profile dropdown and select repository.
Once in your repository, click the NEW button to create a new repository.
Type in the name you choose to use for your new repository.
Then click the "Create Repository" button at the bottom of the page.
That done, now let's launch our GitBash terminal.
Type the command "mkdir thisIsmynewfolder" and hit enter.
Type git init, then type "git remote add origin (the url link)" (URL Link we copied from repository earlier)
Type "git remote -v" to confirm working.
Now type "git add ." then "git commit -m "Initial commit"
Now go on Github,refresh and bang all done.
